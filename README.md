#Python Web Scraper using Selenium

For this project I scrapped data off a site called Running2win. Throughout college I logged all my runs on this app. It was free in college and then they added a subscription fee and I stopped using it. So with this script I scrapped all my running logs year by year. I added them to a csv file and saved them. 

Found out this site is super old. Most to all elements were in tables which I thought was funny. Devs certainly didn't keep up with maintaining it. 

Fun exercise with web scraping. Hopefully this ends up being a more useful tool I can come back to in the future.
